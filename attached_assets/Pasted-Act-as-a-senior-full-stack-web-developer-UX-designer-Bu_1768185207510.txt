Act as a senior full-stack web developer + UX designer. Build a modern, fast, SEO-friendly photography business website for Canada.

BUSINESS / BRAND
- Business name: “(PRIMO PHOTO)” (make this editable in one place)
- Location: Canada (English primary). Add optional French toggle (basic translation layer) but do not require full bilingual content; structure it so it can be expanded later.
- Services: Weddings, Business/Corporate, Models/Portraits, Artists/Press Kits, Events, Product/Branding, Lifestyle.
- Brand personality: premium, clean, minimal, cinematic. Emphasis on trust, professionalism, and high-end visual storytelling.

GOALS
- Convert visitors into leads: primary CTA is “Book a Consultation” and secondary CTA “View Portfolio”.
- Collect inquiries: contact form + calendar link placeholder + WhatsApp is NOT used (Canada). Provide Email + Phone + Instagram.
- Showcase work: portfolio with filtering by category and a gallery viewer (lightbox).
- Build credibility: reviews, process, FAQs, about, and pricing starting points (ranges).
- Local SEO: optimize for Canadian cities (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Ottawa) as examples, but allow easy editing.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Use a Next.js (App Router) or React + Vite setup (choose the simplest that works well on Replit).
- Use TypeScript.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Performance: image optimization, lazy loading, responsive images, minimal JS.
- Accessibility: proper headings, contrast, focus states, keyboard-friendly menus, alt text everywhere.
- SEO: meta tags, OpenGraph, Twitter cards, sitemap, robots, JSON-LD for LocalBusiness/ProfessionalService.
- Analytics: add a placeholder for Google Analytics / Plausible (no actual keys).
- Forms: implement a working contact form using a simple backend route (e.g., Next.js route handler) that validates input and sends to a placeholder email service OR logs to console + stores in a lightweight JSON/db (SQLite) on Replit. Add spam protection: honeypot field + basic rate limiting.
- Content management: do NOT require a full CMS. Instead, create a single data file (e.g., /data/siteContent.ts) where all text, prices, services, FAQs, testimonials, socials, and portfolio items are editable.
- Images: use placeholders in /public (or URLs). Build the structure so images can be replaced easily. Include at least 24 portfolio image slots.
